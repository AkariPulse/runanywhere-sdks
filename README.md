## Overview

AkariPulse is an AI-native analytics and execution platform built for Solana traders and crypto users who want faster insight, clearer risk framing, and direct action from a single interface

The platform combines:

- on-demand token analytics
- wallet intelligence
- narrative research
- a live trading terminal
- credit-based access powered by `$AKARI`

AkariPulse is designed around a simple flow:

**Discover → Analyze → Decide → Trade or avoid**

---

## Why AkariPulse

Raw blockchain explorers show transactions

AkariPulse turns on-chain and market data into structured decisions

Instead of jumping between dashboards, feeds, charts, wallets, and bots, users can work inside one product loop:

- find a token in the Terminal
- open a token report
- inspect holders and wallet behavior
- request a narrative digest
- swap via Jupiter when ready

---

## Core Features

## Token Analytics

AI-generated token reports that turn raw data into a structured risk view

### What it includes

- unified risk score from `0` to `100`
- contract risk and trading risk split
- liquidity profile
- holder distribution and concentration
- price and volatility context
- market structure commentary
- practical interpretation for different trader profiles

### Example report logic

- **Final Risk Score** → overall risk framing
- **Contract Risk** → ownership, mint or freeze state, LP lock or burn status, structural flags
- **Trading Risk** → volatility, slippage, route depth, spread behavior, hostile execution conditions
- **Holder Risk** → whale dominance, concentration, growth quality
- **Bot Risk** → sandwich activity, bot presence, abnormal flow

### Typical output

- headline summary
- key points
- metric strip
- price and liquidity breakdown
- security assessment
- community and market context
- actionable interpretation block

---

## Wallet Analytics

Wallet Analytics turns any supported wallet into a portfolio profile with labels, allocation analysis, and concentration insight

### What it includes

- wallet classification
- behavior labels
- allocation by asset category
- top holding concentration
- average and max token risk
- hedge quality assessment
- practical commentary on structure and exposure

### Example labels

- `SOL Maxi`
- `No Hedge`
- `Bluechip Heavy`
- `Meme Hunter`
- `Small Retail`
- `Whale`

### Typical questions it answers

- Is this wallet diversified or all-in
- Does it behave like a degen, farmer, or directional holder
- Is this structure worth copying or fading
- Where is the real portfolio risk coming from

---

## Narrative Radar

Narrative Radar is an AI agent focused on news, social signals, and evolving market narratives

### What it does

- clusters discussion into narratives
- tracks attention intensity and direction
- generates token-focused digests
- generates sector or theme digests
- adds context around why a token is being discussed right now

### Query types

- **Token-focused**
  - example: `Give me a narrative summary for token X`
- **Sector-focused**
  - example: `Show me current narratives around Solana memes`

### Digest structure

- headline summary
- key drivers
- risk and caveats
- practical takeaway

> [!NOTE]
> Narrative Radar reflects what is being talked about  
> It does not predict what should happen next

---

## Terminal

The Terminal is the real-time market layer inside AkariPulse

It allows users to monitor tokens, sort by momentum and volume, open analysis instantly, and execute swaps through Jupiter

### Terminal includes

- live token list
- market views
- timeframe switching
- token detail drawer
- quick actions for Analyze and Swap
- market status and update visibility

### Supported views

- Trending
- Volume
- Top Performing
- Graduating
- Graduated

### Supported timeframes

- `5m`
- `15m`
- `30m`
- `1h`
- `4h`
- `24h`

### Execution flow

1. Select a token
2. Open token detail
3. Run analysis if needed
4. Swap via Jupiter
5. Confirm in wallet

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AkariPulse never takes custody of funds  
> All swaps are executed on-chain through Jupiter with explicit wallet confirmation

## Token Design Beta

Token Design is a simulation layer for exploring tokenomics before launch

It does not deploy contracts  
It does not predict price  
It helps teams reason about structure

### It can model

- total supply
- allocations
- vesting and unlock cliffs
- emissions and rewards
- burns and sinks
- treasury policy
- scenario branches

### Scenario types

- Base Case
- Growth Case
- Stress Case

### Key outputs

- circulating supply over time
- allocation shifts
- burn versus emissions
- unlock calendar
- structural warnings

---

## Burn Dashboard

The Burn Dashboard gives transparent on-chain visibility into how `$AKARI` is burned and how treasury allocations move

### Dashboard focus

- total `$AKARI` burned
- burned value in USD
- current circulating supply
- treasury balance
- recent burn events
- burn and treasury charts over time

### Why it exists

Every credit purchase is tied to on-chain token routing  
The dashboard acts like a public audit layer for that flow
