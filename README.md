## What is Akari Pulse?

Akari Pulse is an AI‑powered trading and on‑chain analytics platform built around Solana (with more chains planned).  
It lets you:

- Scan tokens before entry, with liquidity, volume and risk overlays  
- Analyze wallets: PnL, behavior patterns, degen level, smart‑money flows  
- Use AI agents to get human‑readable breakdowns and news digests  
- Go from signal to swap via integrated Jupiter swaps

No spreadsheets. No ten tabs. One pulse for your trading decisions.

## Core Features

- **Token analytics** – liquidity, volume, volatility, holders, on‑chain flows, risk scores  
- **Wallet analytics** – PnL, winrate, behavior tags, exposure, “whale / smart‑money” tracking  
- **AI analytics agent** – chat interface for token & wallet breakdowns  
- **AI research agent** – on‑demand news summaries and project digests  
- **Jupiter swaps (Solana)** – swap any supported tokens right from the terminal  
- **Multi‑platform** – web app, Telegram mini app, browser extension with shared account and state  

---

## Credits, Plans & Token

Akari Pulse uses a credits model:

- Every account gets a **free tier** with a small amount of credits  
- Paid plans give more credits and unlock advanced features  
- Credits are spent on:
  - Token analysis
  - Wallet analysis
  - News / research digests
- Credits are purchased using the on‑chain utility token **$AKARI**  
- A share of each purchase is burned, the rest goes to the treasury (transparent dashboards planned)

Exact numbers for tiers and per‑action costs are work in progress and will be documented as they stabilize.
